# ai_hacks_autumn 2022

I participated in a hackathon focused on predicting task closing time at https://hacks-ai.ru/. The objective of the challenge was to predict how much time would be required to close a ticket.

The training dataset consisted of 9859 rows, with 4000 of them having accompanying comments. There were features available such as the task author, ticket assignee, their positions, job types, and more.

One notable aspect was the wide range of the R2 metric, spanning from 60 to 7014000.

In the final results, I secured the 7th position and won a prize of 700 EUR.
